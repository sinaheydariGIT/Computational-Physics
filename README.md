# stock_price.c 
A program that simulates the variation of stock price over time. You can set the expected return per annum, the time step, the standard deviation, the number of walkers (investors in this case), and the starting stock price.  

For initial stock price of $20.0, expected return and standard deviation of 14% and 20% per annum (respectively) and 200 walkers, the results are shown below.
